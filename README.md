# GhostTyper

GhostTyper helps you write text drastically faster, by letting AI correct typos automatically.

![demo](https://github.com/swen128/ghosttyper/assets/15214385/b121a81c-9f3d-4ea2-a8d2-d9e879c52d22)

## Usage
Whenever you've made a typo, invoke the `GhostTyper: Fix Typo` command via hotkey (`Ctrl + ;` by default) or the command palette.
You can then forget about them and keep on typing.

The command works on the line at the cursor position, or current selection range if any.

## Requirement
It needs an OpenAI API key to work. You can get one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
