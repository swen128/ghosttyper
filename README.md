# Type faster. Stay in the flow. 

GhostTyper helps you write text drastically faster, by automatically correcting typos you've made.
You can throw away the backspace key, and just keep focused on what you want to write.

## Usage
Pressing the shortcut keys (`Ctrl + ;` by default) triggers the correction of the current line the cursor is on.

## Requirement
It needs an OpenAI API key to to work. You can get one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
